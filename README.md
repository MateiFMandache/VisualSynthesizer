# VisualSynthesizer
A synthesizer which allows you to draw the waveform of the sound to be produced

In order to run this synthesizer, you will need the playsound python module, which can be installed thus:

    pip install playsound

You may need to create a directory called "Sounds" inside the directory where you have the python file. This is where the sound files will be created. This program doesn't just create sounds, it also creates files for future use. The filename can be customised!

Have fun!
